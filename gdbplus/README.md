#### Introduction
gdbplus is an extension to the formal releases of GNU debugger gdb
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) with core analyzer incorporated. It supports
the same functions, such as heap scan, object reference search, memory pattern
analysis, etc., with the additional power of debug symbols. The result is clear
picture of the memory layout and object relationship of data objects. These
added features may shed light on tough issues such as memory corruption,
debugging highly optimized code, race condition, etc. The current
implementation is tested on x86_64 architecture including RedHat/SUSE both
32-bit and 64-bit, MacOSX 64-bit only. It won't be difficult to port to other
platforms if necessary.

#### Features
A set of gdb commands are added to this custom build. Detail description of
these functions may be found in the project's website:
http://core-analyzer.sourceforge.net/

##### How to Build
The source bundle includes the executable "gdb" under `bin`. You may simply
copy this executable on to your machine where `gdb` is installed, for example,
`/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`. If you want to build by yourself, you will
need to download the corresponding verion of gdb
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/). Copy gdbplus source and header
files (gdbplus/gdb-7.5.1/gdb) into the respective subfoler of downloaded
source. Then build as usual.
```
$./configure
$make
```
